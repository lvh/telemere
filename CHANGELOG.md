# `v1.0.0-beta1` (2024-04-19)

> **Dep/s**: [Telemere](https://clojars.org/com.taoensso/telemere/versions/1.0.0-beta1) and [Telemere SLF4J provider](https://clojars.org/com.taoensso/slf4j-telemere/versions/1.0.0-beta1) are on Clojars.

This is Telemere's first public pre-release and mostly intended for early testers and those that'd like to give feedback.

While no significant changes are expected before the [planned v1.0 final release](https://www.taoensso.com/roadmap), you **probably don't want to use this in production** just yet.

**Please report any unexpected problems** and let me know if anything is unclear, inconvenient, etc. Now's the ideal time to get any last-minute changes in. Thank you! 🙏
